# Web App From Scratch @cmda-minor-web 1920

In this course you will learn to build a web application without frameworks or unnecessary libraries, but with vanilla HTML, CSS & JavaScript as much as possible. The end result is a modular, single page web app (SPA). Data will be retrieved from an external API of your choice, manipulated and finally shown in the UI of the App. You will learn different ways to structure code and develope your own coding style. With the gained knowledge you will be able to build interactive prototypes, based on real data. Also you will gain a better understanding of the how API's, frameworks and libraries work.

## Learning goals

* _You can add structure to your code by applying patterns. You can defend the choice for the chosen patterns_
* _You can retrieve data, manipulate it and dynamically convert it to html elements using templating_
* _You understand how you can work with an external API using asynchronous code_
* _You understand how you can manage state in your application and you inform the user of state where necessary_

## Best Practices
All work during this course will be tested against our [Best Practces for JavaScript](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vTC69BUOGNQj_bLQE9LiprKGYChzb4LOoROoUiLUP8DReOcFLqS5k90Wu1LK9L5r1IVq7BDA1qISp5u/pubhtml).

<!-- Add a link to your live demo in Github Pages üåê-->

<!-- ‚òùÔ∏è replace this description with a description of your own work -->

<!-- replace the code in the /docs folder with your own, so you can showcase your work with GitHub Pages üåç -->

<!-- Add a nice poster image here at the end of the week, showing off your shiny frontend üì∏ -->

<!-- Maybe a table of contents here? üìö -->

<!-- How about a section that describes how to install this project? ü§ì -->

<!-- ...but how does one use this project? What are its features ü§î -->

<!-- What external data source is featured in your project and what are its properties üå† -->

<!-- Maybe a checklist of done stuff and stuff still on your wishlist? ‚úÖ -->

<!-- How about a license here? üìú (or is it a licence?) ü§∑ -->
